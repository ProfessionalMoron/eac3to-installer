# eac3to-installer
Installs unzip, wine and eac3to. Also makes a alias for easy runs.

How to run:  
Elevate with:

sudo su -

and then   

bash <(curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ProfessionalMoron/ae8fe748606f6e0cf031cae218856e3e/raw/d71194d5099c5f7c38566746207cc903701acc6d/eac3to_install.sh)

After that restart your ssh session for alias to work. Then you can use eac3to by just running "eac3to file.mkv"
